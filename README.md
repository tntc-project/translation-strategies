# TML-Strategy

Translation metalanguage of translation strategy scheme, consisting of strategy typology and a list of examples has been developed in the TNTC project supported by the JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (S) 19H05660: [Developing a Translation Process Model and Constructing an Integrated Translation Environment Through Detailed Descriptions of Translation Norms and Competences](https://tntc.p.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/).

## Author

TML-Strategy-v1-EN was developed by Mayuka Yamamoto and Masaru Yamada. The strategy typology is the outcome of adapting translation strategies proposed by Chesterman (2016) to English-to-Japanese translations given in translation training handbooks. We appreciate the groundbreaking work by Chesterman (2016). The details of the development of strategy typology, including the process of adaptation from Chesterman (2016) and the original contribution of the typology, are described in Yamamoto and Yamada (2022).

The Excel file for download was created by Mayuka Yamamoto.
